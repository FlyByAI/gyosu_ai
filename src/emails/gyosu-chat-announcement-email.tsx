          We are thrilled to introduce GyosuChat â€“ A chat assistant that can create lessons plans, quizzes, exams, worsheets, and more, all through an easy to use chat interface. At Gyosu, our dream is to make it easier for teachers to create high quality, customized content for their students, and we believe this is a step in that direction.

          This innovative tool is more than just a chatbot; it is a research assistant built on top of high-quality textbooks provided by <A href="https://openstax.org">OpenStax</A>, an open source textbook provider. Our chatbot is designed to use the educational material from these textbooks when creating it's content, so you can trust that the output is high quality and accurate.
