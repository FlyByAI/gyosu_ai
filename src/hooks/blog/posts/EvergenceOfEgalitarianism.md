# The Emergence of Egalitarianism in a Tech-Dominant World

## The Human Labor and Capital Dichotomy

Human labor and capital have historically been anything but egalitarian. The more human labor required in producing a product, the less equal the distribution of its benefits. Take the figure of Jeff Bezos for example, whose exotic vacations far outpace ours, simply because he commands small armies of human labor to fulfill his desires. However, when it comes to accessing better movies or superior search engines, we stand on the same ground, signifying a egalitarian characteristic intrinsic to technology. _For instance, regardless of one's wealth, we all have equal access to the same shows on Netflix and the same search engine access on Google._

## The Egalitarian Nature of Code and Media

Code and media, by their very nature, are inherently democratic. Thousands of users accessing the same content tend to improve its quality for everyone, as opposed to it being accessed by a single user. This means, whether you're a billionaire or an average citizen, your access to digital products like movies or search engine results remains equal. _This is akin to a global village gathered around a digital bonfire, sharing stories; the narratives grow richer with each addition, regardless of the social standing of the contributors._

## The Zero-Sum Game of Physical Luxury

The story is strikingly different when we consider physical luxury goods. Luxury items like a Rolex watch operate on a zero-sum game principle; the more people possessing them, the lesser their allure. Wealthy individuals can combat this by inflating prices artificially or by increasing the quality to a very high level, ensuring that these luxury goods remain out of reach for the average consumer, and continue to signal wealth. A Lamborghini serves simply as a signal of wealth, rather than a means of transportation. _Imagine an expensive, exclusive party. If the doors were thrown open for all, it wouldn't be 'exclusive' anymore, would it?_

## The Folly of Real-World Luxury

This principle of scarcity driving value doesn't extend to digital services. If a service like Netflix were exclusive to the wealthy, its overall value would drop due to the reduced user base. And luxury cars, like a Lamborghini, don't offer superior practicality; they can't exceed local speed limits and are thus less suited for regular roads. A Lamborghini serves simply as a signal of wealth, rather than a means of transportation. _The ideal car is likely something like a prius or civic._

## Middle-Class enjoys many luxuries which are no longer luxurious

The middle class now enjoys some of the best products and services. As we shift from human labor to automation, we're seeing an increasing egalitarianism in the consumption of goods and services. This can even be seen in the food industry, where the main difference between what the rich and the middle class eat lies more in the presentation (a human labor element) than the actual food consumed. _Imagine two dishes, one served in a high-end restaurant and another in a casual eatery. The ingredients might be the same, but the presentation and the price tags could vary greatly. Jeff Bezos likely eats the same types of lettuce as everyone else, and has to do red light therapy during his lunch break to signal his wealth._

## Bridging the Gap with AI and Tech

With AI and tech playing increasingly dominant roles, the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' seems to be diminishing. The democratizing power of technology is enabling equal access to products and services, making our world more egalitarian. _This trend is much like the increasing accessibility of smartphones across the globe, which provide similar functions regardless of the user's socio-economic status._

## An Egalitarian World Powered by Code and Media

The rise of wealth generated through code, media, and AI-fueled products, in lieu of human labor, leads to a world that's more egalitarian. We're stepping into a new era where the digital realm could be the great leveler, minimizing socio-economic disparities and heralding an age of increased access and equality for all. _A simple analogy would be the transformative impact of e-learning platforms, offering world-class education to students irrespective of geographical boundaries._

## The Contradictory Nature of Network Effects

However, this thesis isn't without contradictions. Network effects potentially contradict the egalitarian narrative. These effects create a 'winner takes all' scenario, leading to informational monopolies. We will delve into this crucial aspect in an upcoming blog post, exploring how network effects could disrupt the egalitarian trends we're witnessing today. \_Think about Facebook or Google, dominating their respective spheres, leaving little room for competition. There is only one dominant search engine, and one Facebook.\_
