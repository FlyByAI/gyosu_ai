## The Case Against Pausing AI Development: Why Progress in Conversational AI Matters

In our discourse on the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, there's been a prevailing narrative championing the need to pause AI development. However, I'd like to propose an alternative perspective and highlight a reason why we should continue to innovate, drawing parallels with how technology often catalyzes greater societal equality.

### A Level Playing Field in the Tech Industry

In a previous post, I expounded upon how tech giants like Netflix have democratized access to entertainment, fostering a level playing field. In this context, it matters not whether you are wealthy or part of the average populace; everyone gets to enjoy the same premium content. The pursuit of revenue maximization ensures an egalitarian distribution of the viewing experience.

However, this paradigm isn't necessarily applicable to the field of artificial intelligence.

### The Risk of Exclusive AI Access

Presently, some of the most powerful AI tools, like ChatGPT, are accessible to everyone at no cost, while the groundbreaking GPT4 model comes at an affordable price. But what if this egalitarian ethos were to shift, leading to an exclusive access model? Imagine a scenario where the next-level "GPT-Ultra" is covertly marketed only to affluent individuals, willing to splurge $1000 per month.

### The Power of Network Effects in AI

What if a superior model could be trained using inputs from human interactions with GPT4 but not made universally available? It's essential to understand that AI, particularly in its conversational form, is more analogous to social media platforms than it is to Netflix. The effectiveness and prowess of these AI systems grow with increased human interaction, thereby implying that these conversational AIs exhibit network effects. The AI that attracts the most usage and feedback is likely to dominate the market.

### The Importance of Democratizing AI

In essence, the continued development and democratization of AI technologies like GPT5 are crucial to avoid the risk of creating an AI-elite, preserving the accessibility and network effects that benefit us all. So, perhaps we shouldn't hit the brakes on AI progress just yet.
