            "1.1.A.1": "A function is a mathematical relation that maps a set of input values to a set of output values such that each input value is mapped to exactly one output value. The set of input values is called the domain of the function, and the set of output values is called the range of the function. The variable representing input values is called the independent variable, and the variable representing output values is called the dependent variable.",
            "1.1.A.2": "The input and output values of a function vary in tandem according to the function rule, which can be expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, or verbally.",
            "1.1.A.3": "A function is increasing over an interval of its domain if, as the input values increase, the output values always increase. That is, for all a and b in the interval, if a < b, then f a( ) < f b( ).",
            "1.1.A.4": "A function is decreasing over an interval of its domain if, as the input values increase, the output values always decrease. That is, for all a and b in the interval, if a < b, then f a( ) > f b( )."

            "1.2.A.1": "The average rate of change of a function over an interval of the function’s domain is the constant rate of change that yields the same change in the output values as the function yielded on that interval of the function’s domain. It is the ratio of the change in the output values to the change in input values over that interval.",
            "1.2.A.2": "The rate of change of a function at a point quantifies the rate at which output values would change were the input values to change at that point. The rate of change at a point can be approximated by the average rates of change of the function over small intervals containing the point, if such values exist.",
            "1.2.A.3": "The rates of change at two points can be compared using average rate of change approximations over sufficiently small intervals containing each point, if such values exist."

            "1.3.B.2": "For a quadratic function, since the average rates of change over consecutive equal-length input-value intervals can be given by a linear function, these average rates of change for a quadratic function are changing at a constant rate.",
            "1.3.B.3": "When the average rate of change over equal-length input-value intervals is increasing for all small-length intervals, the graph of the function is concave up. When the average rate of change over equal-length input-value intervals is decreasing for all small-length intervals, the graph of the function is concave down."

            "1.4.A.1": "A nonconstant polynomial function of x is any function representation that is equivalent to the analytical form n n−1 n−2 p( ) x = an n x + a −1x + an−2x +… + 2 a2x + a1x a + 0, where n is a positive integer, ai is a real number for each i from 1 to n, and an is nonzero. The polynomial has degree n, the leading term is n anx , and the leading coefficient is an. A constant is also a polynomial function of degree zero.",
            "1.4.A.2": "Where a polynomial function switches between increasing and decreasing, or at the included endpoint of a polynomial with a restricted domain, the polynomial function will have a local, or relative, maximum or minimum output value. Of all local maxima, the greatest is called the global, or absolute, maximum. Likewise, the least of all local minima is called the global, or absolute, minimum.",
            "1.4.A.3": "Between every two distinct real zeros of a nonconstant polynomial function, there must be at least one input value corresponding to a local maximum or local minimum.",
